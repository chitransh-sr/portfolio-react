                            Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internetâ€”as a
                            service.
                            Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet,
                            freeing yourself
                            from complex software and hardware management.<br />

                            COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including
                            between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are
                            infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others.<br />
